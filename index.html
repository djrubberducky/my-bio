			<h2>My Name is Daria üåà</h2>
			<p>
				I was born at beautiful Ukrainian city called Lviv. I've traveled and moved a lot. I also lived in Kyiv until a Revolution of Dignity began. My apartment was a kilometer away from all events so it was scary to live. We also lived on the first floor. You never know when the bomb hits you in the window, right? We moved back to Lviv and lived with my grandmother. Fortunately she found an extra room for us. Since now is June 2018, I can safely and exhilarately announce that I finally completed my school education. (YAAAY!). To be frank, I have never studied well. Even worse than an average student. My life outside the school is much more interesting than their, I hope. When I was 14 I began to act in night clubs as a DJ. So.... interested? Scroll down)

			<h2>There is also ducky inside</h2>
			<p>
				I'm Rubber Ducky, in case you didn't know. When I was 14 I went to DJ's PARADEK school named after Derick and Tonika. According to the rules of the school, they could not accept me because I was too young. But in the rules they made an exclusion for me and I started my DJ education. It was exhilarating. Every day we learned something new. I thought and believed that DJing is my vocation. After some time I was invited to such parties as basseidon and vape festival. I like djing, it makes me feel somewhat free, somewhat popular, somewhat loved and I just love the process of creating DJ set. I'm also trying to produce my own music but for now I'm only good at doing crazy mashups. I play from 5 to 10 my own mashups on each party. I'm stuck for now and can't play at parties because I have not enough practice on DJ equipment but it's a matter of time.

			<h2>Wanna talk, Julia?</h2>
			<p>
				My best friend in school was Julia. She was crazy(She called herself pigeon) and it attracted me to her the most. She never feared coming to a stranger and just started talking, laughing, and so on. And although I loved to laugh at her, I greatly respected her in my soul and considered her an example to follow. One example I can even bring. I always went to school by bus in which one nice guy always went to work. I admired  him for years and did not dare to come and get acquainted. One day I said to myself "Now or never!" and to this day I walk with him till morning and go to various music festivals. I miss Julia so much. She moved to Odessa and we get in touch not so frequently as we could.
